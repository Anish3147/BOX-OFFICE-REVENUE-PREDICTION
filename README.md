## Introduction

The Box Office Revenue Prediction System aims to help producers and film studios make informed decisions by providing an estimate of a movie's revenue before release. By leveraging historical data and machine learning algorithms, the system can provide revenue predictions that can be used for budget planning, marketing strategies, and more.

## Features

- Predicts box office revenue using various machine learning models.
- Supports different input features such as cast, director, budget, release date, genre, and more.
- Allows for fine-tuning and optimization of the prediction model.
- Provides data visualization tools for better understanding of feature importance and model performance.
