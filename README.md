## Introduction

The Box Office Revenue Prediction System aims to help producers and film studios make informed decisions by providing an estimate of a movie's revenue before release. By leveraging historical data and machine learning algorithms, the system can provide revenue predictions that can be used for budget planning, marketing strategies, and more.

## Features

- Predicts box office revenue using various machine learning models.
- Supports different input features such as cast, director, budget, release date, genre, and more.
- Allows for fine-tuning and optimization of the prediction model.
- Provides data visualization tools for better understanding of feature importance and model performance.

## Technologies Used

- **Python** (version 3.x)
- **Machine Learning Libraries**: 
  - Scikit-learn
  - TensorFlow or PyTorch (optional, for deep learning models)
- **Data Analysis Libraries**:
  - Pandas
  - NumPy
- **Data Visualization Libraries**:
  - Matplotlib
  - Seaborn
- **Jupyter Notebook** (for development and testing)

## Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/box-office-revenue-prediction.git
   cd box-office-revenue-prediction
2. **Create a Virtual Environment (Optional but recommended)**:
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate   # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
4. **Install Dependencies**:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
## Usage
1. **Data Preprocessing**:
   - Place your dataset in the data/ directory.
   - Run the preprocessing script to clean and prepare the data.
    ```bash
       python preprocess_data.py

3. **Training the Model**:
   - Train the model using the training script.
    ```bash
   python train_model.py
   
5. **Making Predictions**:
   - Once the model is trained, use it to make predictions on new data.
    ```bash
    python predict.py --input new_movie_data.csv
4.**Jupyter Notebooks**:
   - You can explore the Jupyter notebooks in the notebooks/ directory to understand the development and testing process.

## Dataset
The system uses a dataset containing historical movie data with features like budget, genre, director, cast, runtime, and release date. The dataset should be in CSV format and contain relevant fields required for training the model.

## Model Training
- The system supports multiple machine learning algorithms:
  - Linear Regression
  - Decision Trees
  - Random Forest
  - Gradient Boosting
  - Neural Networks (optional)
You can configure the model parameters in the config.py file and run the training script.

## Evaluation
- The model's performance is evaluated using metrics such as:
    - Mean Absolute Error (MAE)
    - Mean Squared Error (MSE)
    - Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)
- Evaluation results are displayed after training, and you can visualize the results using the provided plotting functions.
